#Infrastructure delivery pipeline documentation

###Overview

This project is part of the exam portfolio for the course IDATA2502 - Cloud services administration.
The project aims to create an infrastructure delivery pipeline that automates the deployment, testing and management of cloud-based services. This invloves integrating infrastructure as code, CI/CD workflows and robust testing. This is to have a robust, reliable and efficient deployment process.

I am using OpenStack for a stack which includes a frontend and backend server for hosting a simple concept chat-website. You can write and send messages which will be stored on the backend.
